# Command Line

### You should already know about
* [Trees](../trees/README.md)
* [Paths](../paths/README.md)

The command line allows you to interact with your computer in a flexible and powerful way. It's one of the tools of choice for web developers and programmers in general. Below we're going to cover a few of the most common commands that you run on the command line, and we'll make good use of the tree data structure and paths that you've already learned about.

On out Macs, we interact with the command line via an application called the **Terminal**. The Terminal application comed pre-installed on your mac. To access the terminal type `command (âŒ˜)` + `space` and type in `terminal` then press enter.

I like to use an application called **iTerm 2** instead of Terminal because it adds some nice features in addition to everything that the Terminal offers. You're welcome to use either one. To get iTerm 2, follow [this link](http://iterm2.com/) and download it.

After opening up the Terminal app I'd also recommend right clicking on it in your dock and selecting `Options` > `Keep in Dock` because you will be using it very often.
