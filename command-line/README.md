The command line allows you to interact with your computer in a flexible and powerful way. It's one of the tools of choice for web developers and programmers in general. Below we're going to cover a few of the most common commands that you run on the command line, and we'll make good use of the tree data structure and paths that you've already learned about.

On out Macs, we interact with the command line via an application called the **Terminal**. To access the terminal type `command (âŒ˜)` + `space` and type in `terminal` then press enter.
