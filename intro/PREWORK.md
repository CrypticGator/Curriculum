# Austin Frontend Engineering Pre-Work
Three months is a short amount of time to teach you everything you need to know to be a great front-end developer. To make sure that we can move as fast as possible and cover all of the topics that we need to cover, I've put together a list of exercises and reading materials to get you up to speed. Please complete this work before the first day of class.
