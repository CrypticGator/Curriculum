Homework:
1. Create a functions.js file that implements all of the unfinished functions in [this file](https://github.com/theironyard/js-assignments/blob/master/js-functions-practice/exercises-1.js). Start by writing unit tests for each function before you start to write the actual functions. Commit your tests before any of the function code is implemented! After your tests are complete, implement the functions.
2. Complete this [TDD Mocha / Chai](https://github.com/theironyard/js-assignments/tree/master/tdd-mocha-chai-1) assignment.
