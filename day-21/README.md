<!-- # Day 21: Design Talk, git Branching and Merging

## Goals
- Learn some basic design fundamentals so that we can make our projects look a little bit nicer.
- Learn how to branch, merge and resolve conflicts with git.

# Assignment
1. Today we're going to put together a really solid portfolio piece. Revisit one of the following projects and improve the design to the best of your ability. Refactor the code so all of the indentation is correct, it's split into logical parts, variables are named intuitively, etc. This is going on your portfolio, so create something you are proud of. You can do as much or as little as you want here, but in the end, employers are going to judge you primarily on your portfolio, so make it count. Push your updated project to github.
	- Game shell: Since this is already in backbone, in addition to cleaning it up you should create an actual game. Even if it's a simple number guessing game, slot machine, etc. Hard mode would be implementing Tetris, Sudoku, a crossword puzzle, minesweeper, or Galactica.
	- IMDB movie list: Refactor using Backbone. Add the ability to have multiple users each with their own list. Make it look good.
	- Chat room: Refactor using Backbone. Make it look good. -->
