# Paths

### You should already know about
* [Trees](../trees/README.md)

As we learned when we were talking about trees, paths are a sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant. Usually when we talk about paths we are talking about files or resources on our computer, or on a server. If you think about it, the file system on your computer can be represented as a tree data structure. For example, on my computer I have a root folder that contains a Users folder. The Users folder contains an alarner folder and the alarner folder contains a bunch of other folders.
