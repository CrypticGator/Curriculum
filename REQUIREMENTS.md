# Graduation Requirements

For those of you who will not be graduating on July 23rd, 2015 I've included all of the information you will need in the coming weeks to finish up your work at The Iron Yard. It's important to note that all of these are **requirements** for graduation. If you miss any of these, including the check-ins you will not graduate. Requirements include:

1. Completing the important homework assignments.
2. Checking in weekly, either via email or in person depending on the week.
3. Completing your final project.

## My Availability

These check-ins are required, but are not the only times that I am available for help. You are welcome to slack me at any time (I'll respond when I can) or schedule a time for an in-person or skype one on one (preferred). I will be out of town from:

* 07/28/2015 through 08/02/2015
* 08/08/2015 through 08/22/2015

I will be harder to reach during these dates, but skype meetings are possible if you give me enough notice.

## Honor Code

I wish I didn't have to bring this up, but since this has been an issue in the past it's here. Your work must be your own. You may not copy and paste code from anywhere online, including from other students. You may of course use the internet for helping you solve problems, but all the code that you submit must be your own. Anywhere that you do find other code that helps you in completing these graduation requirements, you must attribute the source (stackoverflow, blog post, github, etc.) in the comments of your code. You must be able to explain each line of code that you write, including code that you find in other places.
