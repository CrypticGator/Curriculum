# Assignment
1. Read about [backbone routers](http://backbonetutorials.com/what-is-a-router/).
2. Have you finished your backbone ToDo list making full use of models and collections?
	- If no: finish that.
	- If yes: refactor your IMDB movie watch list to use backbone.
3. Write a blog post about `this`. It could be a story you make up or a technical description of how it works, or anything else. Somehow incorporate the biggest things you learned about `this` today into your post.
