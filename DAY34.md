# Day 34

Goals:
* Express
* Sending Emails (nodemailer / mailgun)
* .gitignore file
* Twilio

Resources:
* [express](http://expressjs.com/)
* [node twilio api](https://www.twilio.com/docs/node/install)
* [nodemailer](http://www.nodemailer.com/)

Homework:
* Rebuild the [jquery contact form](https://github.com/TIY-Austin-Front-End-Engineering/jquery-contact-form) but use react + backbone instead.
* Using express and nodemailer update your contact form so that it emails you all of the information once you've successfully submitted the form.
* Hard mode: When a new contact form is submitted, use Twilio to send yourself a text notification.
