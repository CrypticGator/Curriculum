# Day 1: Structure of HTML Documents

## Goals
1. Get all necessary software installed (Sublime, Dropbox, Chrome)
2. Put together a basic HTML5 page linking in a CSS file, a JS file and an image.
3. Understand how to layout a fixed width page with CSS.


# Goal 1: Install Sublime and Dropbox
##[Download & Install Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)

> Sublime Text is one of the most popular tools for writing code because it strikes a good balance between simplicity and power. At their core, all tools like sublime do essentially the same thing: let you create and edit text files. Some alternatives to Sublime are Coda, Notepad++, TextWrangler, Eclipse, Netbeans, vim, emacs. The list goes on and on. I require all students to use Sublime so that we are all on the same page and so that we can share tips and tricks for how to use our editor more efficiently.

##[Download & Install Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)

> If you haven't already heard of Dropbox, it's an incredible tool for storing and sharing files. You'll use it to submit assignments and put your projects up on the web.

##[Download & Install Google Chome](http://www.google.com/chrome/)

> Chrome is the browser of choice for many web developers because it is fast, has a powerful set of tools for manipulating web pages and debugging problems in your code. It also uses the Webkit rending engine, which is also used by Apple's Safari browser, so if it works on Chrome, it's likely to work on Safari too.

# Goal 2: Put together a basic HTML5 page
## Bare bones HTML5 page
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        <script src="greeting.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello world! This is a HTML5 page.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
