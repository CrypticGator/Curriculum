# Day 14 - JS: Prototypes, Regex

## Topics
* JS Prototypes
  * Everything is an object
  * If you don't have a property, look it up on the prototype
  * It's **not inheritance**!! It is a pointer reference
  * Add to a prototype (create a new string method)
  * Create a prototype with a constructor
  * Create a prototype without a constructor: `Object.create()`
* JS Regex
  * What and why is regex?
  * Anatomy of a regex
    * `//`
    * patterns
    * flags
  * `.match()`, `.replace()`
* this, call, apply
* Array methods: mutable vs. immutable
