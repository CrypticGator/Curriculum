# Day 32 - React: Props, State, Component Lifecycle

## Topics
* Props
  * Passing values as props
  * Using `this.props`
* Backbone Models/Collections
* Data modeling
<!-- * State
  * Props v. state
  * Where does state live?
  * Setting initial state
  * Updating state: `this.setState()` -->
<!-- * Component Lifecycle
  * `componentWillMount`
  * `componentDidMount`
  * Updated state or props -->

## Notes
* Why do we want to use models/collections instead of just plain object?
  * consolidate data related behavior
  * save to server
  * fetch from server
  * uniform data structure (defaults)
  * data validation
  * custom functions to manipulate data
  * safe keeping of data via getters and setters
  * notification of changes via events
