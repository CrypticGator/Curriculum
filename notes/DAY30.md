# Day 30

Goals:
* Parse user registration and login

Resources:
* [backparse](https://github.com/alarner/backparse)

Homework:

Build out a sercure registration system using react, a backbone router and parse. There should be three pages (register, login and profile) and consistent navigation. *You only need to build out the logic for registration page* for this assignment, but the login and profile pages should exist you should be able to get to them using the navigation.

#### registration page

The register page should be hooked up to your backbone router. If you are on the register page and you refresh the page it should not switch you to a different page. There should be three input fields:

1. email (type text)
1. password (type password)
1. confirm password (type password)

There should be one submit button. When you click on the submit button or press enter it should attempt to register a new user. The form should display (within the HTML in red text) the following errors:

1. "Please enter an email address" if the email input field is empty
1. "Please enter a password" if the password input field is empty
1. "Please confirm your password" if the confirm password input field is empty
1. "Passwords do not match" if the password and confirm password fields do not match
1. "The email looks wrong" if there is a value entered in for the email address, but it is not a valid email address.
1. Any errors that come back from parse should be displayed in red as well. For example, a user should not be able to register twice with the same email address.

Any errors that are not generated by parse should appear directly underneath the relevant input field. For example, if the email address is empty, the error should appear underneath the email address input field, but if the password field is empty the error should appear underneath the password input field.

Hint: use `this.setState` in your event handler and `this.state` in your render method.

If there are no errors and the user was created successfully, you should redirect to the profile page.
