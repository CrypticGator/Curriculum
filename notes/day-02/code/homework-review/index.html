	<!-- We talked about how the containing div here is unnecessary. Instead,
	just style the anchor tag itself -->
	<div class="border-button">
		<a href="index.html" class="border-button">GO TO HOME PAGE</a>
	</div>

	<!-- This is a cleaner way of writing the code above -->
	<a href="index.html" class="border-button">GO TO HOME PAGE</a>
	<!-- If we have two buttons that should look the same, we should have one
	class that they both share. This allows us to write cleaner, more concise
	code and only have on plce in our CSS to make changes if the style of the
	buttons change -->
