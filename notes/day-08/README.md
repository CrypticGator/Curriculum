# Day 08 - JS: Loops, Functions, Arrays

## Topics
* Loops
  * initialization (usually declaring a variable for counting where we are in the loop)
  * condition (the test to determine whether or not to run the code)
  * final expression (code to run after the code has run, before checking the condition again)
  * statement (code to run on each go through the loop)
* Functions
  * What and why is a function?
  * Anatomy of a function
    * `function` keyword
    * parameters
    * statement
    * return value
  * expression vs declaration
  * invoking a function (arguments vs parameters)
* Arrays
  * What and why is an array?
  * Anatomy of an array
    * square brackets: `[]`
    * `,` delineated
    * can contain any value that can be stored in a variable
  * Retrieving array values
    * zero indexed
    * 'bracket notation'
  * `.length`
  * Looping over an array
* Forking / cloning
