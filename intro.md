# Welcome to The Iron Yard Frontend Engineering Course in Austin

I'm super excited to have you all join me for what will be a really fun and exciting three months. Below you'll find a bunch of useful information to get you prepared and started learning how to code. One of our awesome instructors in Houston put most of this together. Thanks [Matt](http://github.com/matthiasak)!

Cheers!

Aaron

# Schedule

- Class is from `January 5th` to `March 27th`.
- Lecture is from `9.30 AM to 12:30 or 1 PM Monday-Thursday`, with breaks during that time. Depending on the topic, we may end earlier or later. :-)

# Office hours and one-on-one instruction

I will be available Monday-Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM at minimum. During lab time, you can schedule one-on-one time with me. After hours, I may be available in the classroom or in [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/), which we will use for group communication.

# Materials

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop to class. I recommend the 13" MacBook Air or Pro. The only upgrade (if any) you should purchase is 8GB of RAM. I have had one for several years, I use it almost too often, and it has never failed on me. :-)

Your MacBook must be running [OS X Yosemite](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12), which is a free upgrade from the App Store. [Download and install it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12) if you haven't yet.

**Accounts to sign up for:**

There is no commercial software required for the class. We will install a number of tools to be used, such as a code editor and chat program.

# Prework

Here is some prework to prepare for The Iron Yard's Front End Course!

Prework is material to help you get on the same page as others. Do the best you can, and let Matt know how it's going! :-)

What is prework?

- a series of base information designed to bring you up to speed as much as possible before the class. We have some online coursework, tools, and advanced materials for those of you who want to go further.
- starting learning before the class is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start, you need to train beforehand. In our classes, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. This prework is training for your brain.
- Prework only covers the basics of a language; What we teach goes much deeper than tutorials can cover.

**Part 0**

Check the software and accounts you will need in the [Materials sections](#materials). Signup for any accounts that you currently do no have.

**Part 1**

Read [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)

Compose an email to Matt answering the following questions:

- Which type of mindset (growth or fixed) do you think you are most strongly associated with? Why?
- What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?

**Part 2**

Start these and finish (as much as humanly possible):

1. Learn to use the terminal (estimated time, 4 hours)

    The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. We will be using the command line extensively in our class, but the point of this prework is not to be an expert, just to start to get comfortable.

    Especially if you’ve never used the command line before, you may want to go through these more than once. Make sure not just to read/watch, but really dive in and use the commands that you learn about.

    Read the following article and complete the course on Treehouse:

    > Note: Treehouse has free 14-day trials. Just use a trial.

    - http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-the-console

2. Learn some basic HTML and CSS

3. Start learning JavaScript

    - http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript

4. Start learning Git

    - https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real

Spend ~ 1-2 hours each day on the courses to round out any foundational knowledge necessary to start Matt's class.

**Part 3**

If you are ready for more advanced stuff, whet your whistle with this bonus material:

- watch these podcasts (there are new releases approx. every week): http://www.atozcss.com/
- start the Codecademy jQuery course: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery
- Rocked the other stuff and still hungry for more? Have a read through of Douglas Crockford’s “JavaScript: The Good Parts”: http://it-ebooks.info/book/274/

# Policies

Sounds boring, but these are important:

- Absences and timeliness - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

- Late or incomplete homework - Your homework is due by 9 AM on the assigned day. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

- Honor - You are expected to do your own work. If you don't, why are you here? You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project. Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting career support.

- Conduct - I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally spoken, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Got an issue with someone? **If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, and we generally care for the well-being of our students.**

# Final Projects

> Also called the *Capstone Projects*

This is going to be a large project that you will carry out **BY YOURSELF OR WITH A RAILS STUDENT** to show off on Demo Day.

More information on your final project will be posted here as demo day draws closer.
