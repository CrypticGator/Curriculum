# Materials

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop to class. I recommend the 13" MacBook Air or Pro. The only upgrade (if any) you should purchase is 8GB of RAM. I have had one for several years, I use it almost too often, and it has never failed on me. :-)

Your MacBook must be running [OS X Yosemite](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12), which is a free upgrade from the App Store. [Download and install it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12) if you haven't yet.

# Prework

Here is some prework to prepare for The Iron Yard's Front End Course!

Prework is material to help you get on the same page as others. Do the best you can, and let Matt know how it's going! :-)

What is prework?

- a series of base information designed to bring you up to speed as much as possible before the class. We have some online coursework, tools, and advanced materials for those of you who want to go further.
- starting learning before the class is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start, you need to train beforehand. In our classes, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. This prework is training for your brain.
- Prework only covers the basics of a language; What we teach goes much deeper than tutorials can cover.

**Part 0**

Check the software and accounts you will need in the [Materials sections](#materials). Signup for any accounts that you currently do no have.

**Part 1**

Read [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)

Compose an email to Matt answering the following questions:

- Which type of mindset (growth or fixed) do you think you are most strongly associated with? Why?
- What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?

**Part 2**

Start these and finish (as much as humanly possible):

1. Learn to use the terminal (estimated time, 4 hours)

    The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. We will be using the command line extensively in our class, but the point of this prework is not to be an expert, just to start to get comfortable.

    Especially if you’ve never used the command line before, you may want to go through these more than once. Make sure not just to read/watch, but really dive in and use the commands that you learn about.

    Read the following article and complete the course on Treehouse:

    > Note: Treehouse has free 14-day trials. Just use a trial.

    - http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-the-console

2. Learn some basic HTML and CSS

    - http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web,
    - https://dash.generalassemb.ly/

3. Start learning JavaScript

    - http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript

4. Start learning Git

    - https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real

Spend ~ 1-2 hours each day on the courses to round out any foundational knowledge necessary to start Matt's class.

**Part 3**

If you are ready for more advanced stuff, whet your whistle with this bonus material:

- watch these podcasts (there are new releases approx. every week): http://www.atozcss.com/
- start the Codecademy jQuery course: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery
- Rocked the other stuff and still hungry for more? Have a read through of Douglas Crockford’s “JavaScript: The Good Parts”: http://it-ebooks.info/book/274/

# Policies

Sounds boring, but these are important:

- Absences and timeliness - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

- Late or incomplete homework - Your homework is due by 9 AM on the assigned day. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

- Honor - You are expected to do your own work. If you don't, why are you here? You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project. Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting career support.

- Conduct - I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally spoken, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Got an issue with someone? **If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, and we generally care for the well-being of our students.**

# Final Projects

> Also called the *Capstone Projects*

This is going to be a large project that you will carry out **BY YOURSELF OR WITH A RAILS STUDENT** to show off on Demo Day (Friday, December 12th).

## Here are some technical requirements for your Final Projects:

- You must either do the project **BY YOURSELF OR WITH A RAILS STUDENT**. If you partner with a Rails student, the Rails student will create an API, and you will connect to it via vanilla jQuery or Backbone.js.
- You must make atleast 25 commits throughout the 3 week period.
- You must have tests written for your project. No matter how simple they are, **You must write tests**.
- You must use a script loader. (loader.js)
- You must have `"use strict";` in your code.
- You must implement proper error handling if arguments don't meet expectations (`throw new Error("some error message")`).
- You must use lodash templates.
- You must use use atleast 2 different service APIs.
- You must use atleast 2 different Browser APIs.
- You must either include polyfills for older browsers, or gracefully show error messages for browsers that don't support a Browser API.
- You must structure your code with Single Responsibility Principle in mind.
- Your UI must be **responsive** and work on both desktop and mobile
- Your app must **SAVE DATA** be it through an authenticated API from `hello.js`, a Rails API, or Firebase.

## Further Requirements BEFORE YOU CODE ANYTHING

- If you have 2 REST APIs, you will probably have two sets of (Collections / Models) for each. List what they would be.
- You will always focus on an MVP (Minimum Viable Product); which means you will have to *ruthlessly* prioritize features of your app
- Your Project proposal to me (Matt) must start with an elevator pitch:
    - 15 to 25 words of what your app does
- You will outline the MVP features in a clearly documented bulletpoint list.
- You will need to research your APIs (especially when doing a solo project) to ensure you can talk to that API without a server-side proxy. If a server-side proxy is needed, **you need to verify this immediately and let Matt know**.
- You will document **all** the technologies and libraries to be used in the project.
- You will document atleast 5 User Stories about your app.
    - e.g. _"As an admin user, I want the ability to create courses so that learners can see what courses are available."_

    > User stories follow this structure: "As a ________ I want _______ so that ________"

## Pitching The Projects

Start thinking about final projects a week ahead of time, and meet with me if you're devoid of ideas. Try to make sure your projects are centered around things you truly care about; bee-keeping, beer, dancing, hiking, basketball, etc. This makes a huge difference and can make the project a lot of fun.

Remember to check the [Resources Section](#resources) for inspiration.

Community feedback is invaluable in keeping scope-creep out (not having hidden challenges surface in the middle of the project) and making sure the projects are the right mix of ambition, talent, feasibility, and hubris (a careful mixture of all four is required, IMHO). **SO, ASK YOUR PEERS FOR FEEDBACK.**

## Start Small, Grow with Agility

Start with a prioritized list of Developer Tasks, APIs, Models/Collections, User Stories, and Screens. We will tell you if we think what you proposed as doable in 3 weeks.

Either way, we will help you prioritize what to do first so make sure you can reach a point that you can demo your app on Demo Day.

**How does Matt typically prioritize and group tasks?**

Usually, I consider the User Experience. If I have a feature, I expect it to work, and work well. Then, as I complete tasks, I know if I am on-schedule, or behind schedule.

This process is somewhat akin to building a Car, but starting with a Scooter:

> see https://pickcrew.com/how-to-build-an-online-business/balance-design-and-launching-early/ for more on this.

## Chronological outline and things to consider

- **EVERY DAY** - you will checkin with me, tell me what you did yesterday, what you plan to do today, and what "blockers" you are running into.

#### Week 1

- wireframe the UI, draw it out, and plan it step by step
- plan your API code, coordinate with your Ruby teammate (if any), and figure out how to save information to Ruby from Backbone.
- use Agile practices to breakdown your **software features** into **user stories**.
    - prioritize the most important features
    - then prioritize the most important user stories

#### Week 2

- develop
- write tests
- review with Matt atleast twice during the week

#### Week 3

- develop
- write tests
- review with Matt atleast twice during the week

## Resources

We already outlined a [TON of REST / Browser APIs and UX Patterns here](./day24.md)

## Final Project Q&A

1. Where do we have to be during final projects? In the lab? Home?

    Monday through Thursday, be at START in the morning. We will be holding some small lectures here and there, and I will be helping to answer questions. **If you don't show up, ask questions, and drive your project in this crucial 3-week period, you won't receive career support.**

    Fridays you will be free to work from home. (But we'll still have `#IronPints™`)

- How often will lectures happen, and will they be optional?

    They will happen probably two to three times each week; in the mornings. Some lectures will be optional, some will not. I will let you know in Hipchat ahead of time.

- How long will lectures be?

    They will be kept to a maximum of 1.5 or 2 hours.

- What content will be covered?

    Check the [Lectures Remaining](#lectures-remaining) section.

- How often do we checkin with the instructor? What about the campus director?

    You must checkin with your instructor, in the morning, twice a week (we'll be counting). Twice each week, you should also be checking in with the campus director to discuss career support.

- How much job-related stuff should they be doing?

    This is a case-by-case basis, but The Iron Yard staff will be sending y'all job-related resources to help kickstart the job searches. Best rule of thumb:

    - During final projects, do only two 1-hr job searches each week. That means, pick two evenings (Tues, Thurs), schedule them on your calendar (to get alerts so you don't forget), and don't do anything more.
    - After final projects, you will want to apply to 3 jobs each day.

    **I (Matt) already have some cool job sites and search engines for you, [collected here (link)](./examples/extras/job-resources.md). You're welcome :-)**

- What are the deliverables? Should we have feature X done by next week, etc.?

    We will plan projects out and have some good prioritized task lists for projects. Students' jobs will be to come to the instructor with the plan in mind, and the instructor will help you tweak it.

- What do they have to wear/say/bring/do at Demo Day? Are there going to be practice runs?

    We will discuss this with the class; but Demo Day will be done in a "Houston Livestock & Rodeo Show" style, where projects will get voted on while displayed around the room, and then the top 4 projects will get to demo the app for everyone.

- What happens if I don't finish?

    You don't present.

- If I don't finish, will I receive career support?

    Not until you finish the project (you get to do that after class) and show you worked hard. The real hustle begins after class, when you start the job hunt. I'll teach you to fish, but I won't fish for you. :-)
