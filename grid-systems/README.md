If you build enough websites you start to see patterns that repeat over and over again. When we lay out our pages they often follow a consistent pattern of columns and rows. Grid systems in CSS are a commonly used to lay out our content in a consistent and standardized way. They organize our HTML and make developing responsive websites easier and faster.

Grid systems are simply a methodology for how to lay out content on your pages. There are a number of different CSS frameworks and libraries out there that use the grid system methodology. Some of the popular ones are [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [Bourbon Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/). Most of these frameworks and libraries use a CSS pre-processor such as Sass.

Grid systems are generally split up into three parts: gutters, columns and rows. Gutters represent the space in-between content and columns are where the content lives. Grid systems will have a pre-determined, or configurable number of gutters and columns (often 12 columns and 13 gutters).
