# Assignment
1. Using Javascript and window.prompt, create a number guessing game. The game should randomly generate a whole number between one and one hundred and ask the player to guess the number. After each guess, the game should tell the player if they guessed too low, too high, or if they were correct. If they were not correct then it should prompt them to guess again.
	- Use functions to organize your code.
	- Be sure to validate all function arguments.
	- Use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to style the page with instructions on how to play the game.
