# Goal 1: Install and use Yeoman
## Install Yeoman
> You will only ever need to do this once.

1. brew install node
2. sudo npm install -g yo bower gulp generator-gulp-webapp

## Use Yeoman for a new project
> You will repeat this process for every new project and homework assignment that you create.

1. Create a new repo on GitHub
2. Clone your repo into your projects folder
3. On the command line, `cd` to the new directory that was created when you cloned the repo.
4. Generate the code for your new app: `yo webapp`
5. Serve your new webapp: `gulp serve`
> You need to run this command each time you start working on your web app. It will watch your scss files, run a local webserver and automatically reload your page when it detects changes.
