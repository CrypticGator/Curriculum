# Day 24: Advanced Backbone Models, Views and jQuery tricks

## Goals
- Learn how to use backbone models to sync to a resful API
- Learn how to trigger events on views.
- Advanced backbone routing.
- jQuery .html() vs .text() and javascript injection.

# Assignment
- Modify one of your previous Backbone assignments to use Tiny Pizza Server to permanently store information. For example:
	- todo list: As you add a new todo item, post that information to tiny pizza server.
	- imdb movie watch list: Save movies as they added to different lists on your page.
	- chat server: use model.save() instead of $.post to send messages to the server.
- You can use postman GET requests to ensure that your data is being saved correctly.
