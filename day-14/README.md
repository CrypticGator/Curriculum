# Day 13: AJAX!

## Review
- HTML 4 col navigation
- Javascript function arguments
- brew install wget

## Goals
- $.get and $.post
- Learn how to query an API with Javascript (IMDB)


# Assignment
1. Build a webpage that has three main elements: a search text box, a search button and a results box. When the user clicks on the search button, display the contents (value) of the search text box in the results box.
2. Update assignment 1 to now query the [IMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) (via a $.get request) when the user clicks on the search button. console.log the response.
3. Update assignment 2 to display the response from IMDB in a table inside of the results box (instead of console.log'ing it).
4. **Hard Mode:** Update your results box to allow your user to click on a result to add it to another list of movies that they want to watch (their "to watch" list).
5. **Extra Hard Mode:** Allow your user to move movies from their "to watch" list to a new "watched" list (movies that they have already seen).
6. **Insane Mode:** Save the users lists using [window.localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.localStorage) so that when you refresh the browser window their previous lists still appear.
